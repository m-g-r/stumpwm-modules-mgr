Minimalistic amixer-based volume control for the window manager StumpWM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Just support the three volume control keys on many keyboards.

Depends on amixer which is started via RUN-SHELL-COMMAND.

Hacked by Max-Gerd Retzlaff.


loading and configuration
-------------------------

You can automatically load the module by adding this to your
~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp:

  (load-module "stump-volume-control")

Then assign the three commands volume-up, volume-down, volume-toggle-mute
globally to some keys. If your keyboards has got them you can use the
typical volume control keys:

  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioRaiseVolume") "volume-up")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioLowerVolume") "volume-down")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioMute") "volume-toggle-mute")

But you have to add it yourself to your ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp as I consider
it bad manners to define global keys in a module.


selecting the sound card
------------------------

If you do not want to control the sound card that ALSA considers your
first one (that is, sound card number 0, the default), just alter the
value of the exported variable STUMP-VOLUME-CONTROL:*SOUND-CARD*. For
example, by adding to your ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp:

  (setf stump-volume-control:*sound-card* 1)

Set to NIL to not select any specific sound card explicitly by adding
to your ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp instead:

  (setf stump-volume-control:*sound-card* nil)


PulseAudio compatibility
------------------------

This minimalistic volume control module works mainly for ALSA as it uses
amixer, the "command-line mixer for [the] ALSA sound card driver".
It might work also for PulseAudio as there are compatibility layers
but there might be some shortcomings.

Here is a little workaround to address one problem that was observed:
PulseAudio mutes more than it unmutes. This module includes hack that
will explicitly unmute the audio outputs when toggling audio back on.
It can be controlled by altering the list stored in the exported
variable STUMP-VOLUME-CONTROL:*PULSE-AUDIO-UNMUTE-OUTPUTS*. By default,
it is set to '("Speaker" "Headphone") as "Speaker" and "Headphone" are
the generic output names.

If your hardware uses special names, such as, for example, "Megaphone"
and "Leslie speaker", add this to your ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp:

  (setf stump-volume-control:*pulse-audio-unmute-outputs*
        '("Megaphone" "Leslie speaker"))

Change to NIL if you just use ALSA and do not want the extra calls to
be executed (which will fail silently if you do not have the outputs),
by adding to your  ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp instead:

  (setf stump-volume-control:*pulse-audio-unmute-outputs* nil)

(And now I have again spend more time on the dreaded PulseAudio...)
