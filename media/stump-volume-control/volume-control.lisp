(defvar *sound-card* 0
  "audio device to control by amixer; string, number, or null.
  If it is a string, it will be used as a device name as it is,
  if it is a number it will be translated to the string \"hw:0\",
  if NIL don't send any device at all.

  Alternatively, you can specify a list of multiple audio devices:
    '(0 \"default\")

  And if you set it to a list, it is also possible to name a custom
  control for each device by specifying entries as lists of the form:
    '(<audio-device> <control-name>)
  If no custom control name is given, it defaults to \"Master\".
  The first entry is considered to be the default sound card.

  Example values are:
    0
    '(0 1)
    '(0 \"default\")
    '(0 (1 \"Speakter\"))
    '((0 \"Master\") (1 \"Speakter\")

  Warning: the non-list variant is only for backward compatibility.
  If you want to specify a single audio device but with a custom
  control name, you still have to enclose this single audio device
  in a list like this:
    '((0 \"Master\"))")

  the listed audio outputs will explicitly be unmuted when toggling
  audio back on.

  \"Speaker\" and \"Headphone\" are the generic output names but
  some hardware might expose special names.

  Change to NIL if you just use ALSA and do not want the extra calls to
  be executed (which will fail silently if you do not have the outputs).")
