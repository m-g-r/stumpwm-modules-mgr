  "audio device to control by amixer; string, number, or null.
  If it is a string, it will be used as a device name as it is,
  if it is a number it will be translated to the string \"hw:0\",
  if NIL don't send any device at all.

  Alternatively, you can specify a list of multiple audio devices,
  andin that case it is also possible to name a custom control for
  each device by specifying a list (<audio-device> <control-name>) as
  an entry. If no custom control name is given, \"Master\" is assumed.

  Example values are:
    0
    '(0 1)
    '(0 (1 \"Speakter\"))
    '((0 \"Master\") (1 \"Speakter\")

  Note that the non-list value is only for backward compatibility.
  If you want to specify a single audio device but with a custom
  control name, you still have to enclose this single audio device
  in a list like this:
    '((0 \"Master\"))")
