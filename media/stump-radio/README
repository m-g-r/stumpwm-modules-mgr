a simple mplayer-based radio for the window manager StumpWM
-----------------------------------------------------------

Depends on mplayer which is started via SB-EXT:RUN-PROGRAM.

Hacked by Max-Gerd Retzlaff.


loading and configuration
-------------------------

You can automatically load the module by adding this to your ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp:

  (load-module "stump-radio")

It is suggested to make two commands globally available by some unused keys on
your keyboard by adding this to your ~/.stumpwm.d/init.lisp as well:

  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86Launch6") "radio-toggle-playback")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86Launch5") "radio-next-station")

Or if you happen to have the keys, this is another option:

  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioPlay") "radio-toggle-playback")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioNext") "radio-next-station")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioPrev") "radio-previous-station")

There are more commands (see package.lisp) but usually just radio-toggle-playback
and radio-next-station are all you really need.


radio stations
--------------

The list of radio stations is stored in an internal association list.
Currently added are Le DJAM radio (Paris, France), FluxFM (Berin, Germany),
and 1 Live (Cologne, Germany).

You can add a station with a call like like:

  (stump-radio:add-station :|Le DJAM| "http://www.djamradio.com/sound")

And remove it again with:

  (stump-radio:remove-station :|Le DJAM|)

This is how you can list the station in the REPL:

  (stump-radio:list-stations)
  ;; => (:|Le DJAM| :|1Live| :|FluxFM|)

But you can also list the stations with the StumpWM command radio-list-stations
which will show them as a StumpWM message.
