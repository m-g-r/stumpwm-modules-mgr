Minimalistic mplayer-based radio for the window manager StumpWM
---------------------------------------------------------------

I just want to be able to switch on some music by a press of a button.

Depends on mplayer (which is started via SB-EXT:RUN-PROGRAM).

Hacked by Max-Gerd Retzlaff. The primary source for this module
is https://github.com/m-g-r/stumpwm-modules-mgr


loading and configuration
-------------------------

You can automatically load the module by adding this to your StumpWM
init file:

  (load-module "stump-radio")

It is suggested to make two or three commands globally available
by some unused keys on your keyboard by adding this to your StumpWM
init file as well:

  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86Tools") "radio-previous-station")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86Launch5") "radio-toggle-playback")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86Launch6") "radio-next-station")

Or if you happen to have these keys, this is another option:

  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioPrev") "radio-previous-station")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioPlay") "radio-toggle-playback")
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "XF86AudioNext") "radio-next-station")

There are more commands (see package.lisp) but usually just
radio-toggle-playback and radio-next-station are all you really need.


radio stations
--------------

The list of radio stations is stored in an internal list of the module.
The default stations are Le DJAM radio (Paris, France), FluxFM (Berlin,
Germany), and 1 Live (Cologne, Germany).

You can add a station with a call like like:

  (stump-radio:add-station :|Le DJAM| "http://www.djamradio.com/sound")

And remove it again with:

  (stump-radio:remove-station :|Le DJAM|)

If you want to clear the recommended default radio stations, call this
before adding your own stations:

  (stump-radio:clear-stations)

This is how you can list the station in the REPL:

  (stump-radio:list-stations)
  ;; => (:|Le DJAM| :|1Live| :|FluxFM|)

But you can also list the stations with the StumpWM command
radio-list-stations which will show them as a StumpWM message.


Here are some more stations to add to your StumpWM init file:

  (stump-radio:add-station :|FluxFM Klubradio|
    "http://streams.fluxfm.de/klubradio/mp3-320/audio/")
  (stump-radio:add-station :|1Live DJ Session|
    "https://wdr-1live-djsession.icecastssl.wdr.de/wdr/1live/djsession/mp3/128/stream.mp3")
  (stump-radio:add-station :|1Live Plan B|
    "https://wdr-1live-planb.icecastssl.wdr.de/wdr/1live/planb/mp3/128/stream.mp3")


instant channel zapping
-----------------------

Usually, we terminate mplayer with the POSIX signal SIGTERM. This
might take a bit when mplayer already does some network requests,
as it will handle the SIGTERM only afterwards.

If you absolutely want instant switching of stations and do not care
about letting mplayer properly self-terminate, alter the variable
STUMP-RADIO:*MPLAYER-TERMINATION-SIGNAL* from SIGTERM to SIGKILL by
adding to your StumpWM init file:

  (setf *mplayer-termination-signal* sb-unix:sigkill)

Note that it is not proper to terminate a process by SIGKILL. Probably
no kittens will die in this case of mplayer streaming some music but
be warned.

(You think "Let's keep this simple!" but then there is POSIX and signaling,
 and suddenly...)
